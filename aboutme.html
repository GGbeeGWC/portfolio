<p>As you you can already see from above my name is Ginevra Godwin. 
GG for short. I’m from Jamaica, Queens but I recently moved to Brooklyn 
after 15 year of living there. My new neighborhood is so much different 
than my previous one but it has a similar feel. The new place isn’t ideal 
for my love of playing the piano because it’s an apartment, completely 
different than my old house.</p>
<p>Python and Scratch both have a lot of ways to do the same thing for 
  your code and both of them let you do whatever you want. Python is way 
  more technical and uses symbols. Scratch uses blocks that are pre-made. 
  They also have pictures that you can already use a spirtes. It felt 
  really cool to think that I'm building something that I can likely use 
  later in life. I felt really, really smart as well. I like creating things 
  that come to life. The input thingy was pretty difficult for me.</p>
